# Features

- Jump, run, and attack enemies while navigating through a level. Holding jump gains you more height and longer airtime.

- Complete the level by reaching the exit.
- Avoid getting attacked by enemies and keep your health bar high.

# Installation Requirements

- The game was created specifically with the pygame-ce version of the PyGame framework in mind.
- Install pygame-ce to run 'main.py', the actual game.

# Usage

- Use the arrow keys 'left' and 'right' to move the player character.
- Press `Space` to jump, holding for longer to get a higher jump, and `E` or `X` to attack.
